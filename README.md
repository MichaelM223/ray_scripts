## Description

This repository contains a collection of independent python scripts that were developed 
for use with the [RayStation treatment planning system](https://www.raysearchlabs.com/raystation/). While most scripts are intended to
be loaded into RayStation, others provide ancillary functions such as [CreateReferenceCT.py](https://github.com/mwgeurts/ray_scripts/blob/master/general/CreateReferenceCT.py),
which creates a homogeneous phantom for QA purposes.

## Installation

This repository is set up so that only one script, [ScriptSelector.py](https://github.com/mwgeurts/ray_scripts/blob/master/ScriptSelector.py), actually needs to be imported into RayStation. After downloading a copy of this repository to a location accessible by the RayStation servers, import [ScriptSelector.py](https://github.com/mwgeurts/ray_scripts/blob/master/ScriptSelector.py) and change the variable `repo` to point to the path of the repository. You can then either leave the `module` variable empty, in which case all scripts will be loaded, or set `module` to be a single subfolder within the repository. Finally, set the script name and module accordingly in RayStation and validate the script. Then, when executed, [ScriptSelector.py](https://github.com/mwgeurts/ray_scripts/blob/master/ScriptSelector.py) will search the provided path for all available Python files, and display a list of all scripts to the user. Clicking on a script will execute it.

To use [CreateReferenceCT.py](https://github.com/mwgeurts/ray_scripts/blob/master/general/CreateReferenceCT.py), you will need to install the 
[pydicom](http://pydicom.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html) and 
[numpy](https://scipy.org/install.html) packages. Copies of both packages are included as
submodules within this repository. 

## Usage and Documentation

The following list summarizes each script within this repository as well as the RayStation module it is intended for. Refer to the preamble 
comments within each script for script-specific documentation.

| Module | Script | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| General | [CreateMobius3DDLGPlans.py](https://github.com/mwgeurts/ray_scripts/blob/master/general/CreateMobius3DDLGPlans.py) | Creates and exports a series of DLG test plans to send to Mobius3D for DLG offset optimization. |
| General | [CreateMobius3DValidationPlans.py](https://github.com/mwgeurts/ray_scripts/blob/master/general/CreateMobius3DValidationPlans.py) | Creates and exports a series of simple validation plans for Mobius3D following [AAPM MPPG 5.a](https://doi.org/10.1120/jacmp.v16i5.5768) guidelines. |
| General | [CreateReferenceCT.py](https://github.com/mwgeurts/ray_scripts/blob/master/general/CreateReferenceCT.py) | Creates a homogeneous phantom CT, for use by other scripts in this repository. |
| General | [CreateWaterTankPlans.py](https://github.com/mwgeurts/ray_scripts/blob/master/general/CreateWaterTankPlans.py) | Creates and exports a series of reference dose distributions for use with the [Water Tank TPS Comparison Tool](https://github.com/mwgeurts/water_tank). |
| General | [ImportRecalcDICOMPlans.py](https://github.com/mwgeurts/ray_scripts/blob/master/general/ImportRecalcDICOMPlans.py) | Imports and re-calculates DICOM RT plans |
